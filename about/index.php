    <p>The first Cambridge Pub Database was a map on my wall with pins marking all the pubs with a variety of colours depending on how I personally rated the establishment.  When I mentioned to a couple of my friends that I had started making the map they decided that it would be a great idea to make a website or app that contained the same information that we could all use as a result CamPub was born.</p>
    <p> Prior to writing this site I had done a bit of coding but had never used PHP, SQL or Javascript so it's all been a bit of a learning curve!  On top of that I have written the majority of the code in the pub where I meet with a coupe of other friends on a weekly basis to work on our projects, needless to say it has taken and will likely continue to take some time to complete!</p>
